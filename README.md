# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

Summary of the ride-sharing data by city type was requested by V. Isualize. 

To complete the summary of the analysis, following tasks were assigned by V. Isualize.

1. Create summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
2. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
3. Summarize how the data differs by city type.
4. How data differences can be used by PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Sources:
	- city_data.csv
	- ride_data.csv
	- PyBer_ride_data.csv

- Software: Jupyter Notebook (Version: 6.3.0)
- Kernel: Python (Version: 3.7.10)

## Results:

- Total Rides by city type:
	- Rural: 125
	- Suburban: 625
	- Urban: 1625
- Total Drivers by city type:
	- Rural: 78
	- Suburban: 490
	- Urban: 2405
- Total Fares by city type:
	- Rural: $4327.93
	- Suburban: $ 19356.33
	- Urban: $ 39854.38
- Average fare per ride by city type:
	- Rural: $ 34.62
	- Suburban: $ 30.97
	- Urban: $ 24.53
- Average fare per driver by city type:
	- Rural: $ 55.49
	- Suburban: $ 39.50
	- Urban: $ 16.57

## Summary:

Eventhough fewer rides are taken in the rural cities (125 rides) compared to Suburban (625 rides) and Urban (1625) rides; 
average fare per Ride and per Driver is higher for rural cities compared to other two.
Further analysis may be required to determine the average distance travelled for each ride
